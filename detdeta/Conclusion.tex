This note details a measurement of transverse energy per unit pseudorapidity (\dEtdeta) using data from Run 2024 in \auau collisions at \snn = 200 GeV collected with the sPHENIX detector. The \dEtdeta is measured with the calorimeter system, including the hadronic calorimeter, which is used for the first time for such observables at RHIC. 

\dEtdeta results are shown as a function of $\eta$ and mean \dEtdeta over 0.5\Npart results are shown as a function of \Npart using data from the EMCal, HCal and full calorimeter system. Additional studies of IHCal-only and OHCal-only measurements of \dEtdeta as a function of $\eta$ and $\langle \dEtdeta\rangle/(0.5 \Npart)$ as a function of \Npart are also included in this note. The sPHENIX full calorimeter results are compared to previous STAR and PHENIX results as well as truth-level results from HIJING, EPOS and AMPT. These measurements are presented across a large centrality range showing a strong understanding of the sPHENIX calorimeter response over at least an order-of-magnitude in dynamic range and making this analysis a useful exercise towards accomplishing the sPHENIX jet physics program.
