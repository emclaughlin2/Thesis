Since HIJING gives a particle multiplicity distribution that is asymmetric in $z$(beam)  direction. And afterburner is applied to rotate every other event along $y$ direction for $180$ degrees so that the average HIJING particle multiplicity over a large data set is symmetrical along the beam direction.

This afterburner has been applied to all centrally produced runs from Run10 onwards of the MDC2 prodution and is used in all HIJING samples/data presented by this analysis.
