To account for Run 2023 runs not having z-vertex distributions centered at z = 0, we reweight the MC z vertex distribution to match that of the data. For the runs used in this analysis with $\mid \bar{v_{z}} \mid < 10$ cm, the vertex reweighting factors are not very far from 1 (between [0.5,2.5]) so the vertex reweighting does not have a large effect on the $\text{d}\ET/\text{d} \eta$ distributions.
